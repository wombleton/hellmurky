Why
===

The varroa mite directly affects the number of hives a beekeeper can maintain. Prior to varroa a full-time beekeeper could maintain 700—1000 hives; the present number they can maintain is 500—700. In short: the extra work required to manage varroa has reduced the productivity of beekeeping by approximately a third.

In addition to the extra work, treatment of hives places a testing burden on honey & other bee products.

What
====

At the moment mite detection is either laborious techniques such as dusting with sugar, or uncertain methods such as relying on experienced eyes.

Instead, detection of the varroa mite may be amenable to computer vision. 

The proposal is to gather training images of frames of bees and classify whether they do or do not contain mites. The training images would then be used to develop a program to automatically detect whether a given image contains varroa mites.

Resources
=========

* Strong motivation in the industry to solve this problem
* Well developed community means excellent access to subject matter experts. 
* Active research in computer vision.

Resource Gap
============

* Hosting & storage costs.
* Koha for subject matter experts (both for computer vision & varroa)
* Publicity costs
* Project management costs
